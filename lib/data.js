<br/><u>While recycling is a potentially key means of combatting the global plastic pollution crisis, its efficacy is hampered by “wishcycling”</u>: consumers often place dirty or nonrecyclable items in recycling bins in hopes that they can be used, potentially contaminating otherwise recyclable material; increasing the cost, time, and difficulty of sorting material; and causing damage to machinery involved in the recycling process.
<br/><br/>Text 2
<br/>Despite its prominence in the public eye, plastic recycling is inherently limited, particularly in the United States, which has favored the export of this waste to other nations over the development of robust domestic recycling infrastructure. Even with the appropriate systems in place, only two of the seven common types of plastic are reasonably easy to recycle, and manufacturing new plastic often remains a simpler and cheaper option; on average, less than 10% of post-consumer plastic is actually recycled.
